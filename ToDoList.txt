- use JAR to build docker instead of this horrible, horrible maven thing I'm currently doing
- fix channels that are being listened to by WordGameChannelListener (channel instead of name)
- integrate DB
- add way to add/remove words while running (+ maybe list of all guesses that it didn't know)
- properly kill game with finish
- automatic pinning
- fix scores (+ mentions)
- case insensitive
- add "seed" mechanism where the letters can be chosen at the start
